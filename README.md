# This is my Final Project
This Project has 7 classes which are Address, Department, Student, Assignment, Course, enum Gender, Util. Plus there is Unit testing.
Together what this project is supposed to do is create a student that has an address and can register or drop course. Then we can generate assignments and grades for the student.
After we diplay those grades along with a final score and the average on each assignment depending on the amount of students their are for that assignment.
# Address
This class is an address for a student. The only method used here checks if the postal code is valid or not.

# Department
The department is there above everything else. The courses go in a department and the students belong to a department.

# Student
The student has methods like registering for a course dropping a course.

# Assignment
The methods for this class are to calculate the average on an assingment of many scores, and to generate a random score for a student.

# Course
This class has a lot of methods. First it checks if the weight of all the assignments combined are valid. Then there is register student that registers a student for the course.
Then we have a method that calculates the average of all the students. Then there is a method that generates all the scores for every student as well as a method that adds assignments to the course.
